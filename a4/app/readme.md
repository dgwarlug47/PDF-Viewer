Comments:

i) Erase is undoable, so if you erase and click undo then the drawing will show up again

ii) My code was a bit slow on the emulator, I don't know why. But when paired with a device,
and run the program on my phone then the performance was okay

iii) I used the Zoom/Pan code on the cs3449 github repository to implement my own zoom.
